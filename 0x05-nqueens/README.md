# N Queens Problem Solver

This repository contains a solution to the N Queens problem implemented in [programming language of your choice]. The N Queens problem is a classical problem in the field of computer science and combinatorial mathematics, where the challenge is to place N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Problem Description

The N Queens problem is described as follows:

**Input:** An integer N representing the size of the chessboard (N×N).

**Output:** A solution to the N Queens problem, where queens are placed on the chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other.
